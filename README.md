# IPL-Player-Performance-Predictor
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2018

A player performance predictor that uses the Find-S algorithm. Built as a part of my Machine Learning coursework.

The two CSV files in the repo contain data sourced from Kaggle. I used the python library pandas to do all the data pre-processing.
You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl

The criteria for a "good IPL performance" in my opinion is as follows:

1. A batsman should have a strike rate of at least 120
2. A bowler should have a bowling economy lower than 6.5

I designed Find-S hypothesis space based on the above conditions. You can test the code by running the python script.
Note: The csv files need to be in the same folder.
